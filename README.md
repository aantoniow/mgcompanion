# mgcompanion
Description: 
"My Gaming Companion". An application that will potentially help me get a hold of my gaming backlog 😅.

What should it feature:
- Database! We need to store everything somewhere
- REST! This is for now the communication focus.
- ...
- It should behave in a non-blocking way ...
- Kafka!
-

Future:
Application will store my whole gaming backlog. It should store information about some of my notes, my progress in the game and platform on which this game is available to me right now (potentially, where this game is available on different platforms in the stores).
Next, or maybe somewhere in between... This should have some authentication management and different possible users.
Moving up from the "REST" world to some http or mobile sphere.
